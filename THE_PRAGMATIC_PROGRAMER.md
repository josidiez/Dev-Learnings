# THE PRAGMATIC PROGRAMMER

### 1. Have and Open Mind
Why spend your life developing software unless you care about doing it well?
### 2. Think ! About your work
Turn off the autopilot and take control. Constantly critique and appraise your work.

## A pragmatic philosophy
### 3. Provide options. Don't make lame excuses
Instead of excuses, provide options. Don't say it can't be done; explain what can be done to salvage the situation.

### 4. Don't Live with Broken Windows
Don't mess up the carpet when fixing the broken window.

### 5. Be a Catalyst for Change
Most software disasters start out too small to notice, and most project overruns happen a day at a time.

### 6. Remember the Big Picture

### 7. Make Quality a Requirements Issue
Great software today is often preferable to perfect software tomorrow. **Know When to Stop**

### 8. Invest Regularly in Your Knowledge Portfolio
You need to ensure that the knowledge in your portfolio is accurate and unswayed by either vendor or media hype.

### 9. Critically Analyze What You Read and Hear

### 10. It's Both What You Say and the Way You Say It

## A pragmatic approach

### 11. Good design is easier to change than bad design

### 12. DRY—Don't Repeat Yourself
  - Imposed duplication Developers feel they have no choice—the environment seems to require duplication.
  - Inadvertent duplication Developers don't realize that they are duplicating information.
  - Impatient duplication Developers get lazy and duplicate because it seems easier.
  - Interdeveloper duplication Multiple people on a team (or on different teams) duplicate a piece of information.

### 13. Make it easy to reuse

### 14. There are no Final Decisions.

### 15. Use Tracer Bullets to Find the Target
